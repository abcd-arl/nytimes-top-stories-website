# The NYTimes Top Stories Website

The site takes data from the NYTimes API to serve as a landing and search page for top articles in The New York Times. It allows users to search and browse articles by category and sort them by date.

Throughout creating the project, I made sure everything have the same feel as the original website while also incorporating my own layouts. It is also web responsive and expected to work beautifully across different screen sizes. The whole program is only written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It also makes use of the Intersection Observer API and is implemented with a skeleton loading.

You may click [here](https://abcd-arl.github.io/nytimes-top-stories-website/) to get you to the live view. Please keep in mind that the NYTimes API only allows limited requests per minute. You may have to wait for a couple of seconds then hit refresh once the limit has been reached. If an error occurs while fetching resources, the site should provide you a link to use the saved JSON files instead.
